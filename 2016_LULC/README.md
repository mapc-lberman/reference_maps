# LULC Tile index

json file will load as a map in github, links are in popup

you may post both files to a webserver and view "leaflet_map.html" in a browser.  This provides one click direct links to the .zip files for each tile.  otherwise you will need to copy and paste the links from the popups on the github default map.
