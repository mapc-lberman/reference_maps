_leaflet version:_

you may post both files to a webserver and view "leaflet_map.html" in a browser.  This provides one click direct links to the .zip files for each tile. 

_Github geojson:_

previously github default map of geojson files could be clicked to see popup of the feature attributes.  that functionality has been removed, alas (2022).

_Color ramp_

lulc_2016_tiles_color_ramp.lyrx  is a default color ramp for the downloadable raster tiles.  see the JPG for an example of how it looks.
