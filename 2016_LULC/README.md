https://metroboston.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6e46a0d520384a3b9f4a5e3c1be34d66


leaflet version:

you may post both files to a webserver and view "leaflet_map.html" in a browser.  This provides one click direct links to the .zip files for each tile. 

github geojson:

previously github default map of geojson files could be clicked to see popup of the feature attributes.  that functionality has been removed, alas (2022).
